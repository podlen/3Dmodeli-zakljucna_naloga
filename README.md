# Project Title

## Description

This repository contains the 3D models and associated files for [Briefly describe your project/thesis and the purpose of the 3D-printed parts].

## Files Overview

*   `Source_Files/`: Contains the original CAD files (SolidWorks `.SLDPRT` and `.SLDASM`).
*   `STL_Files/`: (To be added manually) Contains the printable `.STL` files.
*   `Images/`: (Optional) Contains photos of the printed parts and assembly.

## Printing Instructions

*   **Material:** [e.g., PLA, PETG]
*   **Printer:** [e.g., Prusa i3 MK3S+, Ender 3]
*   **Nozzle Diameter:** [e.g., 0.4mm]
*   **Layer Height:** [e.g., 0.2mm]
*   **Infill:** [e.g., 20% Rectilinear]
*   **Supports:** [e.g., No supports needed / Tree supports on build plate only]
*   **Brim/Raft:** [e.g., None / Brim]

[Add any other specific slicer settings or tips for successful printing.]
