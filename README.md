# Določanje lokacije in sile udarca na plošči z uporabo nevronskih mrež

## Description

This repository contains the 3D models for an experimental system designed to determine the location and force of impacts on a 3D-printed plate using machine (deep) learning. The system includes a 3D-printed plate equipped with four 3D-printed resistive sensors to measure dynamic structural response.

## Files Overview

*   `Source_Files/`: Contains the original CAD files (SolidWorks `.SLDPRT` and `.SLDASM`).
*   `STL_Files/`: (To be added manually) Contains the printable `.STL` files.
